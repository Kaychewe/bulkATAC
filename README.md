# bulkATAC
A program for bulk ATAC-seq footprint analysis 
Below are the major steps, the organization of sub-modules, and possible libraries and multithreading optimizations.

**diffATAC - Comprehensive Plan**

1. **Initialization and Argument Parsing**
    - Libraries: Use a library like `argp` or `getopt` for command-line argument parsing.
    - Sub-module: `argparse.c`
    - Tasks:
        1. Parse input BAM files, motifs, and other parameters.
        2. Validate inputs and set defaults where necessary.
    
2. **Read and Parse BAM Files**
    - Libraries: HTSlib for BAM file operations.
    - Sub-module: `bamhandler.c`
    - Tasks:
        1. Open and validate the BAM files.
        2. Read alignments and store relevant data.
    - Multithreading: Utilize multithreading for reading from multiple BAM files simultaneously.
    
3. **Generate Bias Table**
    - Libraries: General C libraries for data structures and operations.
    - Sub-module: `biastable.c`
    - Tasks:
        1. For each unique hexamer, calculate observed/expected values.
        2. Store the bias table in an efficient data structure.
    
4. **Footprint Analysis**
    - Libraries: A fast math library for efficient operations.
    - Sub-module: `footprint.c`
    - Tasks:
        1. Adjust reads based on the bias table.
        2. Identify regions of open chromatin around motifs.
        3. Generate output footprint plots or data.
    - Multithreading: Parallelize operations on different regions of the genome.
    
5. **corRNA Analysis (if correlating with RNA-Seq)**
    - Libraries: HTSlib for potential RNA-Seq BAM files, or other relevant libraries depending on the RNA-Seq data format.
    - Sub-module: `corrna.c`
    - Tasks:
        1. Parse RNA-Seq data.
        2. Correlate open chromatin regions with gene expression data.
        3. Output correlated results in a structured format.
    - Multithreading: Parallelize correlation tasks across different genomic regions.

6. **Output and Reporting**
    - Libraries: Potentially a library like `klib` for efficient data structures and operations.
    - Sub-module: `report.c`
    - Tasks:
        1. Generate comprehensive reports based on the analyses.
        2. Output data in various formats (e.g., CSV, BED, graphical plots).
    
7. **Error Handling and Logging**
    - Libraries: Standard C libraries.
    - Sub-module: `loghandler.c`
    - Tasks:
        1. Handle errors gracefully throughout the program.
        2. Log operations, especially time-intensive tasks, for user feedback.

8. **Optimizations and Performance**
    - Use efficient data structures for genomic regions and tables (e.g., hash tables, tries).
    - Utilize multithreading wherever possible, especially in data-intensive operations.
    - Consider memory usage and optimization for large genomic datasets.

9. **Documentation and User Manual**
    - Create a comprehensive README and user manual.
    - Provide clear instructions on installation, dependencies, usage, and potential troubleshooting.

This structure provides a logical breakdown of the program's major steps, with a focus on modular design. Each sub-module can be developed and tested independently, facilitating collaborative development and debugging.
